					<h2><u>Introduction</u>:-</h2>
						<p>Travelling on a tiresome journey by car; have you ever wondered the mechanism running behind it? Of course not!!But hereâ€™s a chance to test all your engineering skills and design a manual car that can run through the roughest of the part and can drag anything that comes in its way. Drag out the maximum number of blocks through the exit and the team with maximum scores will be rewarded. SO JUST STOP WASTING YOUR TIME & GET YOUR ENGINEERING SKILLS TO WORK! </p>
			  <hr /><h2><u>Problem Statement</u>:-</h2>
						<p>To design a manual wired or wireless car that can drag out blocks from any kind of paths. Drag out the maximum number of blocks through the exit and the team with maximum scores will be rewarded.</p>
              <hr /><h2><u>Bot Specification</u>:-</h2>
						<ul>
							<!--<li>Bots must be autonomous.</li>-->
							<li>The bot size should not exceed 10cm(w) X 15cm(l).</li>
							<li>The bot should not have more than 2 DC geared motors.</li>
						</ul>
			  <hr /><h2><u>Rules & Regulations</u>:-</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>The power supply for the vehicle should be contained on-board. </li>
							<li>The potential difference between any 2 points in the circuit should not exceed 24V. </li>
							<li>Each contestant will be given a fixed time slot. Any delay whatsoever shall result in loss of points.</li>
							<li>The event consists of two rounds: - </li>
							<li>Elimination round and the Final round. The teams qualifying the elimination round will be allowed to participate in the final round.,/li>

						<ul>
							<li>Each block will carry certain points which would be varying according to their difficulty level.</li>
							<li>Eg:- the blocks on the bridge will carry more points as compare to the normal blocks</li>
							<li>The team with the maximum number of points out of the arena in 3mins with the minimum disqualification and maximum points would be declared winner.</li>
							<li>Team with wireless bots will be awarded with bonus points.</li>
							<li>The machine having self made Circuit on breadboard or PCB will get 20 more points in advance.</li>
							<li>The machine best in design and concept will get 5 point extra.</li>
							<li>In case of a TIE, the team having the highest score in both (elimination + final) the rounds will win the event.</li>
							<li>In case of any discrepancy the decision taken by the jury will be treated as final decision.</li>
