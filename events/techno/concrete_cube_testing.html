					<h2><u>Introduction</u>:-</h2>
						<p>Is the concrete you mix ready for the bad tough world out there? Here is an event designed to test just that, to test the skill of your hands and cover yourself with glory even as you dive into depths of this fascinating technology which holds great opportunities for you. This is traditional event in all civil engineering fests without which the fest seems to be incomplete. This event is meant for those who are fascinated by concrete and want to explore more about the material. Mix and cast cubes strong enough to withstand the maximum possible compressive strength after 24 hrs. Of curing and walk away with fabulous prizes.</p>
			  <hr /><h2><u>Problem Statement</u>:-</h2>
						<p>You have to cast a M20 (15*15*15) cm3 concrete cube.</p>
						<p>Cube should be strong enough to withstand the maximum possible compressive strength after 24 hrs using given materials including aggregates, cement, materials, and other used aggregates or other green materials as per your choice and our norms.</p>
              <hr /><h2><u>Event Structure</u>:-</h2>
					<h3><u>Round I</u>:-</h3>	
						<p>There will be a Quiz based on</p>
						<ul>
							<li>General Knowledge. </li>
							<li>General Science.</li>
							<li>Aptitude Questions. </li>
						</ul>
						<p>Quiz has to be solved in maximum 45 minutes at the decided Venue. Teams qualifying the First Round will be promoted to Second Round. </p>
					<h3><u>Round II</u>:-</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>In this round, participants will be provided with all the basic materials (i.e. Cementitious Materials, Coarse Aggregates and Fine aggregates, Water) required for casting concrete cubes in the CONCRETE LAB in CIVIL ENGINEERING DEPARTMENT. </li>
							<li>They can choose the materials in any ratio and mix them to design their cubes. </li>
							<li>The mould will be kept in air for 1 day and thereafter will be placed in CURING TANK for curing for 24 hrs. </li>
							<li>Strength of Concrete Cube will be tested. The Cubes will then be tested under COMPRESSION using Compression Testing Machine. </li>
						</ul>
			  <hr /><h2><u>Rules & Regulations</u>:-</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>Organizersâ€™ decision shall be treated as final and binding on all. The organizers reserve the right to change any or all of the above rules as they deem fit.</li>
							<li>Organizers reserve the right to disqualify any team indulging in misbehaviour or violating any rules. In case of any disputes/discrepancies, the organizer's decision will be final and binding.</li>
							<li>Using of any material in cube for increasing strength or any purpose if found then will be disqualified.</li>
							<li>Using of unfair means would be treated as disqualification.</li>
						</ul>
			  <hr /><h2><u>Judging Criteria</u>:-</h2>
						<h3><u>Round I</u>:-</h3>Around 15- 20 teams will be shortlisted in the quiz round as per their marks for the next round.
						<h3><u>Round II</u>:-</h3>
							<ul>
								<li>Cubes will we tested on the basis of (strength+economical) parameters.</li>
								<li>Use of recycled aggregate will earn bonus points.</li>
								<li>In case of any discrepancy the decision taken by the jury will be treated as final decision.</li>
							</ul>
			  <hr /><h2><u>Team Size</u>:-</h2>A team may contain a maximum of 3 members.
			  <hr /><h2><u>Eligibility Criteria</u>:-</h2>
							<ul>
								<li>All students with a valid Registration Card of DEXTRA 2014 along with their respective educational institutes' ID Card are eligible to participate.</li>
								<li>Non-JUET participants must possess an Accommodation Confirmation Letter (ACL) issued by the organizing body at the time of registration. Registration Card will not be issued without ACL </li>
							</ul>
