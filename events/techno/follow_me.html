                <center><h2>Sensing A Line And Maneuvering The Robot To Stay On Course</h2></center>
            </div><div id="wrapper">
					<h2><u>Introduction</u>:-</h2>
							<p>Line follower is a machine that can follow a path. The path can be visible like a Black Line on a white surface (or vice-versa) or it can be invisible like a Magnetic field.</p>
							<p>Sensing a line and maneuvering the robot to stay on course, while constantly Correcting wrong moves using feedback mechanism forms a simple yet effective closed loop system. As a programmer you get an opportunity to ‘teach’ the robot how to follow the line thus giving it a human-like property of responding to stimuli.</p>
							<p>Practical applications of a line follower: Automated cars running on roads with Embedded magnets; guidance system for industrial robots moving on shop floor etc.</p>
			  <hr /><h2><u>Problem Statement</u>:-</h2>
							<p>Design an autonomous robot capable of sensing black line and can follow it. The robot must always be within the line. The line will consist of various degrees of angles at the turns.</p>
			  <hr /><h2><u>Robot Specification</u>:-</h2>
							<ul>
								<li>The machine should be fully autonomous.</li>
								<li>Machine should be fit in a 25cmx25cmx25cm (LengthxWidthxHight) size of Dimension box, individually.</li>
								<li>Machine should not communicate wireless.</li>
								<li>No limitation of weight. </li>
								<li>The machine should use maximum 30 volt on board power supply. </li>
							</ul>
			  <hr /><h2><u>Details</u>:-</h2>
						<h3><u>Round I</u>:</h3>
							<p>It will be a qualifying round for all the participants. The arena will be simple and basic.</p>
						<h3><u>Round II</u>:</h3>
							<p>The students qualifying round 1 will be allowed. The arena for this round will be difficult and your  robot will encounter :</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Sharp obtuse corners (greater than 90 degrees)</li>
								<li>The line crossing over itself</li>
								<li>Sharp acute corners (less than 90 degrees)</li>
								<li>Gaps in the tape of up to 5cm</li>
								<li>rounded corners (radius greater than 20 cm)</li>
							</ul>
			  <hr /><h2><u>Rules & Regulations</u>:-</h2>
							<ul>
								<li>First round would be the simple line following round.</li>
								<li>The machine should cover complete path of the arena, no shortcut and reverse <br />Turn will be allowed.</li>
								<li>The Machine would have to follow a line of 3cm wide</li>
								<li>The machine should start to run from starting point of arena and stop at ending pad. </li>
								<li>The machine should not damage the arena else team will be disqualified.</li>
								<li>Machine should not leave the path in its time lap else team will be disqualified.</li>
								<li>The machine can transform to its size only at arena. But cannot divide in parts. </li>
								<li>Final round will be a curved path with straight Cuts in path</li>
							</ul>
			  <hr /><h2><u>Judging Criteria</u>:-</h2>
							<ul>
								<li>Line follower without microcontroller will get extra 20 points in advanced. </li>
								<li>The machine having self made circuit on bread board or PCB will get 20 more points extra. </li>
								<li>The machine best in design and concept will get 10 point extra. </li>
								<li>The machine should start to move with 300 second in reverse counting and complete the whole path in minimum time; remaining seconds would be its score. E.g. If a machine is without microcontroller and circuit is design on breadboard or PCB and it complete the path in 60 second then its total sore would be 20+20+240=300</li>
							</ul>
			  <hr /><h2><u>Team Size</u>:-</h2>Maximum three members can form a team
			  <hr /><h2><u>Eligibility Criteria</u>:-</h2>
							<ul>
								<li>All students with a valid Registration Card of DEXTRA 2014 along with their </li>
								<li>Respective educational institutes' ID Card are eligible to participate.</li>
							</ul>
			  <hr /><h2><u>Event Managers</u>:-</h2>
