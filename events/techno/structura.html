								<li>The tower should not be stuck to the surface. </li>
								<li>The tower should be able to stand on the ground without any support. </li>
								<li>The points will be awarded based on height and stability of the tower. </li>
								<li>Team will have to complete their tower within 2 hours.</li>
							</ul>

							<li>For height the points will be given by PH = 0.75 x Height (in cm) 
							<li>For stability test tower will be hit three times by pendulum such that the weight of bob will increase every time. If the tower stumbles against any bob, it will not be tested for higher weights. The weights of the various pendulum bobs would be disclosed at the time of event only. Points awarded for 1ST , 2nd and 3rd ball will be 15, 25 and 35 respectively.
