					<h2><u>Introduction</u>:-</h2>
							<p>Urban planning (urban, city, and town planning) is a technical and political process concerned with the use of land and design of the urban environment, including transportation networks, to guide and ensure the orderly development of settlements and communities. It concerns itself with research and analysis, strategic thinking, architecture, urban design, public consultation, policy recommendations, implementation and management.</p>
			  <hr /><h2><u>Problem Statement</u>:-</h2>
							<p>Plan a township in a given area. Coordinates of the area, Google earth image and keyhole mark up language file will be given. For the analysis of the site you have to visit Google Earth. </p>
			  <hr /><h2><u>Rules & Regulations</u>:-</h2>
						<ul>
							<li><b>Population: </b>Total Population: 1500 (Note: It is the total population including male, female, and children)</li>
							<li><b>No of families:</b> 300 </li>
							<li><b>Area:</b> Total Available area: 4.13 km square Perimeter: 8546.22 m </li>
						</ul>
						<p><u><b>Note 1:</b></u></p>
						<ul>
							<li>If you require any data in your design assume it and mention it in presentation.</li>
							<li>Participants have to give the presentation on their design. We are focusing on green building construction. Clearly mention everything which you are using e.g. Specific material, Technology, Calculation, Assumption, and Estimation etc. </li>
						</ul>
						<p><u><b>Note 2: </b></u></p>
						<ul>
							<li>It is essential to include master plan (coloured) of site in your PowerPoint presentation and a hard copy on A3 size or bigger paper with proper annotation. </li>
							<li>Special points will be awarded if you provide details about utilities like Electricity, Internet etc. </li>
							<li>If you design any network or model using software, you will get bonus for that. </li>
							<li>We are expecting some aspects in your design and weightage of each civil Engineering aspect is also mentioned (out of 70). </li>
						</ul>

						<h3>STAGES</h3>
						<p><b><u>Stage 1</u>:- General Quiz (like any other event with some civil engineering points) </b></p>

						<p><b><u>Stage 2</u>:- Presentation and submission of Model & Master Plan </b></p>
						<ul>
							<li>At this stage the participants would have to present their plan with the help of PowerPoint Presentation and a Model & Master Plan. </li>
							<li>The presentation must contain all the relevant details that may be qualitative or quantitative depending upon the Civil Engineering aspect. </li>
							<li>Marks would be awarded on the basis of the extent of details mentioned, efficiency of design and originality. Thus the participants must add their source of reference wherever required. </li>
							<li>More weight-age would be given to innovation. For example, if participants add their own ideas in addition to the ideas given in the problem statement </li>
							<li>Model to be presented can be made on software’s like AutoCAD etc. </li>
						</ul>			  
			  <hr /><h2><u>Events Details</u>:-</h2>
