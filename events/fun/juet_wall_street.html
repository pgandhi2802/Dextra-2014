					<h2><u>Introduction</u>:-</h2>
						<p>The life of a trader is a life on the edge. The amounts of money in trading keeps on rotating but never seem to materialize. A good trader knows and detects the signals that the market sends and reacts in a proportional way. As a trader you have to be ahead of the herd and the market.</p>
			  <hr /><h2><u>Problem Statement</u>:-</h2>
						<p>The event basically would present before you a new concept of share marketing. Just like big organizations and companies have their own shares in the market, the various events of DEXTRA would have specific amount of shares and the customers (here participants) would be allocated with a fixed amount of capital/virtual money to buy and sell the shares.</p>
						<p>The price of the shares would be refreshed periodically. So, it’s a chance to in-cash the business skills, for those who have the Mania of Share and Business in them.</p>
						<p>Aim of JUET Wall Street is to come up with the team having the highest capital at the end of game. At the beginning all the teams would be provided with a fixed amount of money (virtual), with which they are supposed to build-up their empire.</p>
