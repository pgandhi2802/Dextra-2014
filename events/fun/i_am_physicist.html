					<h2><u>Introduction</u>:-</h2>
							<p>A physicist is a scientist who does research in physics. Physicists study a wide range of physical phenomena in many branches of physics spanning all length scales: from sub-atomic particles of which all ordinary matter is made (particle physics) to the behavior of the material Universe as a whole (cosmology).</p>
			  <hr /><h2><u>Problem Statement</u>:-</h2>
							<p>In this event we'll find a participant who is expert in physics through an exciting quiz.</p>
